# Solutions to Project Euler problems
These solutions are mostly written in Scheme because that is my favorite programming language. You will also find some translations into C, Java, Python, and Ruby.

The Scheme solutions were written in CHICKEN (Gentoo is still stuck on CHICKEN
4) but with `cond-expand` for portability, especially towards Guile
which seems to be the most universally available Scheme implementation on Linux
systems. No fancy libraries are used, for the most part.
